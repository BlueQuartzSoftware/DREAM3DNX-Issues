# DREAM3DNX-Issues

Welcome to the issue and discussion forum for the *DREAM3D* Application v7.0.0 and later. Here you can report issues, discuss new features, and interact with the developers directly.

**Note: For versions below v7.0.0 please report [here](https://github.com/BlueQuartzSoftware/DREAM3D) instead.**

## How it works

The goal of this repository is to aggregate the community to a single repository in order to simplify the very compartmentalized *DREAM3D* repositories. As a primarily open-source company we strongly believe in being as transparent with the community as possible, so here's what happens when you open an issue in this repository:

1. Your issue will be immediately marked with two tags upon submitting: *needs triage* and the respective type of issue
2. A developer will look over your issue and request further information if necessary
3. The tag *needs triage* will be removed and replaced with relevant tags and one or more assignees may be added to your issue
4. At this point, the issue is now in progress and a subsequent issue will be opened in the respective public repositories by the developers and then linked back to this issue for you to reference if you wish
5. Our developers will continue to work on the issue and reach out as necessary, updating when relevant information is available
6. Your issue will be marked as closed, and a subsequent PR/commit will be referenced

Developers will also occasionally appear in the discussion forums to join the discussion on new features and share insights with the community at large. We hope to help users get the best experience out of our applications possible and this is one of the ways we hope to do so.

### Contributor Questions

At BlueQuartz, we believe the might of community is far greater than that of the individual. This is part of the reason we make our code open-source. By doing this we hope to have enthusiastic users contribute to the code base in order to help add new features or features we can't actively update at the time. As part of this, we hope to help new contributors with questions in the discussions forum. We are aware there is a learning curve to contributing to our software, and one way we thought to combat this is to allow the contributors to interact with the developers directly here in the discussions forum. In oder to help you as quickly as possible, and expedite the process, we request you open the discussion with the *Contributor Questions* category specifically. **On behalf of BlueQuartz, and the Material Science community at large, thank you for your contribution to our project!**

### Opening an Issue

Here is how to open a new issue in our repository:

### Opening a Discussion

When opening a discussion it is highly recommended for a user to look through the open discussions and announcements to ensure that an existing discussion is not already open. If an open one is found, feel free to add your feedback to this discussion as this helps us, the developers, find out what to focus on to best help our user base and community.

That being said here are the steps to opening a new discussion:

1. Click on the *Discussions* tab in the menu bar of this repository
2. Click the *New discussion* button in the upper right corner of the newly opened repository window
3. Select the template you think best fits the discussion you want to start
4. Fill out the short form as directed
